Not sure yet, but the main goal is to allow anyone willing to use the instrument, yet forbid commercial usage.
E.g.:
 1. If you have something non-commercial, you are free to use this repo.
 2. If you have something commercial that requires monitoring, but what your company sells is not a program product related to monitoring (like banking services, both internal and external; outsorcing that includes both program product and monitoring; grocery delivery service that wants to expose grafana to the customers), you are free to go as well.
 3. If your company aims to sell monitoring products, you are out of luck. This repo is not for you, sadly. Still, feel free to browse and gain ideas from it to make your product even better.
